# Advanced Code2Prompt Usage Patterns

Once you've mastered the basics of Code2Prompt, you can leverage its advanced features to supercharge your development workflow.

## Custom Templates

Create your own prompt templates using Handlebars:

```handlebars
{{#each files}}
## File: {{this.path}}
```{{this.extension}}
{{this.content}}
```

{{/each}}

```

## Selective Processing

Target specific parts of your codebase:

```bash
code2prompt src/components --include "*.jsx" --depth 2
```

This will significantly improve the quality of AI-generated responses by providing more focused context.
