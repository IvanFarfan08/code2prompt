title: How the Glob Pattern Filter Works
description: An in-depth look at how Code2Prompt processes include and exclude patterns.
---

Code2Prompt uses glob patterns to include or exclude files and directories, working similarly to tools like tree or grep. It lets you pass two independent _lists_ of glob patterns:

- **include list** (`--include` or `-i`) - “these patterns allow files”
- **exclude list** (`--exclude` or `-e`) - “these patterns disallow files”

Code2prompt must decide, for every file in the project, whether it is kept or discarded. This page explains the rules, the special role of `--include-priority`, and the design choices behind them.

## 1. Sets and symbols

Throughout the explanation we use the usual set notation

| Symbol                            | Meaning                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| $A$                               | set of files that match **at least one** include pattern |
| $B$                               | set of files that match **at least one** exclude pattern |
| $\Omega$                          | the whole project tree (the _universe_)                  |
| $C = A \cap B$                    | files that match both lists (the _overlap_)              |
| $D = \Omega \setminus (A \cup B)$ | files that match neither list                            |

## 2. Four basic situations

1. **No include list, no exclude list**

   $$
   A = \varnothing,\;B = \varnothing
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   \text{result} = \Omega
   $$

2. **Exclude list only**

   $$
   A = \varnothing,\;B \neq \varnothing
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   \text{result} = \Omega \setminus B
                  \;=\; \neg B
   $$

3. **Include list only**

   $$
   A \neq \varnothing,\;B = \varnothing
   \quad\Longrightarrow\quad
   \text{result} = A
   $$

4. **Include _and_ exclude lists**

   Here there is an overlap $C = A \cap B$ that satisfies contradictory
   rules: “keep” (because it is in $A$) and “discard” (because it is in $B$).
   The flag `--include-priority` exists _solely_ to resolve that
   contradiction:

   | `--include-priority` | result               | set expression                        |
   | -------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
   | _off_ (default)      | keep $A \setminus B$ | $A \setminus B$                       |
   | _on_                 | keep _all_ of $A$    | $(A \setminus B) \cup (A \cap B) = A$ |

   Note that the “rest” $D$ is **never** included when an include list is
   present - otherwise the include list would no longer behave as a
   whitelist.

### Visual Representation of Case 4

Let (A) and (B) overlap. Depending on the priority, the intersection $$( A \cap B )$$ is either included or excluded based on the `include_priority` parameter. By default, the intersection is excluded (exclusion primes over inclusion).

## 3. Why keep `--include-priority`?

For trivial directories you can drop `--exclude` and obtain the same set of
files. But in real-world projects we frequently need the pattern

- include _many_ files (e.g. “every `*.md`”)
- exclude _huge_ sub-trees (e.g. `node_modules/**`, `target/**`)
- keep just a handful of exceptions _inside_ those excluded trees  
  (e.g. `node_modules/**/LICENSE`, `docs/private/keep.md`)

Without `--include-priority` you must choose between

- removing the exclusion (pulls thousands of files back), or
- writing a gigantic include list that enumerates every allowed path.

The flag offers an ergonomic shorthand:

```bash
code2prompt . \
  -i "**/*.md,node_modules/**/LICENSE" \
  -e "node_modules/**,target/**" \
  --include-priority
```

One line, easy to read, easy to maintain.

## 4. Quick reference table

| Want to keep…                                  | Use                              |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| everything                                     | no `-i`, no `-e`                 |
| everything _except_ some patterns              | `-e` only                        |
| _only_ what matches the patterns               | `-i` only                        |
| what matches `-i`, minus what matches `-e`     | `-i` **and** `-e`                |
| same as above **but** keep the overlap as well | `-i`, `-e`, `--include-priority` |

---

This design keeps the mental model simple:

- The include list is a whitelist as soon as it exists.
- The exclude list is a blacklist layered on top.
- The flag `--include-priority` changes the fate of the _overlap only_, nothing else.
