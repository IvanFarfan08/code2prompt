</Card>

**TL;DR**

```sh
cargo install code2prompt
```

## Prerequisite

Make sure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and cargo are installed on your system.

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This is the official way to install the latest stable version of Rust and Cargo.
Make sure to refresh your `PATH` variable after installing Rust. Restart your terminal or run the instructions proposed by the installer.

```sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

You can check that everything is installed correctly by running:

```sh
cargo --version
git --version
```

## Command Line Interface (CLI) 👨‍💻

### Cargo

#### 📦 Install from crates.io (Stable release)

This is the easiest and recommended way for most users:

```sh
cargo install code2prompt
```

#### 🧪 Install the latest (unpublished) version from GitHub

If you want the latest features or fixes before they're released on crates.io:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/mufeedvh/code2prompt
```

### Source build

Ideal for developers that want to build from source or contribute to the project.

<Steps>

1.  🛠️ Install Prerequisites :

    - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and Cargo
    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2.  📥 Clone the repository :

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/mufeedvh/code2prompt.git
    cd code2prompt
    ```

3.  📦 Install the binary :

    To build and install from source:

    ```sh
    cargo install --path crates/code2prompt
    ```

    To build the binary without installing it:

    ```sh
    cargo build --release
    ```

    The binary will be available in the `target/release` directory.

4.  🚀 Run it :

    ```sh
    code2prompt --help
    ```

</Steps>

### Binary releases

Best for users that want to use the latest version without building from source.

Download the latest binary for your OS from [Releases](https://github.com/mufeedvh/code2prompt/releases).

⚠️ Binary releases may lag behind the latest GitHub version. For cutting-edge features, consider building from source.

### AUR

### Automated installation

The `code2prompt` MCP server will soon be available in MCP registries.

### Manual installation

The `code2prompt` MCP server is still a prototype and will be integrated to the main repository soon.

To run the MCP server, locally to use it with `Cline`, `Goose` or `Aider`:

<Steps>

1.  🛠️ Install Prerequisites :

    - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - [Rye](https://rye.astral.sh/)

2.  📥 Clone the repository :

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/odancona/code2prompt-mcp.git
    cd code2prompt-mcp
    ```

3.  📦 Install the dependencies :

    The `rye` command will create a virtual environment and install all the dependencies in the `.venv` folder.

    ```sh
    rye sync
    ```

4.  🚀 Run the server :

    The MCP server is now installed. You can run it using:

    ```sh
    . .venv/bin/activate
    python -m src/code2prompt_mcp/main.py
    ```

5.  🔌 Integrate with Agents :

            For instance, you can integrate it with `Cline`, using a similar configuration:

            ```json
            {
              "mcpServers": {
                "code2prompt": {
                  "command": "bash",
                  "args": [
                    "-c",
                    "cd /home/olivier/projet/code2prompt-mcp && rye run python /home/olivier/projet/code2prompt-mcp/src/code2prompt_mcp/main.py"
                  ],
                  "env": {}
                }
