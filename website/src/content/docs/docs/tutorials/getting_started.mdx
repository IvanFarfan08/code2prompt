<Card title="Tutorial Overview">
  Welcome to Code2Prompt! This tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to
  using Code2Prompt to generate AI-ready prompts from your codebases. We'll
  explore its core functionality and demonstrate its usage across different
  integration methods: Command Line Interface (CLI), Software Development Kit
  (SDK), and Model Context Protocol (MCP).
</Card>

## What is Code2Prompt?

Code2Prompt is a versatile tool designed to bridge the gap between your codebase and Large Language Models (LLMs). It intelligently extracts relevant code snippets, applies powerful filtering, and formats the information into structured prompts optimized for LLM consumption. This simplifies tasks like code documentation, bug detection, refactoring, and more.

Code2Prompt offers different integration points:

  <TabItem label="CLI" icon="seti:powershell">
    A user-friendly command-line interface for quick prompt generation. Ideal
    for interactive use and one-off tasks.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="SDK" icon="seti:python">
    A powerful Software Development Kit (SDK) for seamless integration into your
    Python projects. Perfect for automating prompt generation within larger
    workflows.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="MCP" icon="seti:db">
    A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for advanced integration with LLM
    agents. Enables sophisticated, real-time interactions with your codebase.

## üì• Installation

For detailed installation instructions for all methods (CLI, SDK, MCP), please refer to the comprehensive [Installation Guide](/docs/how_to/install).

## üèÅ Generating Prompts: A CLI Example

Let's start with a simple example using the CLI. Create a sample project:

```bash
mkdir -p my_project/{src,tests}
touch my_project/src/main.rs my_project/tests/test_1.rs
echo 'fn main() { println!("Hello, world!"); }' > my_project/src/main.rs
```

Now, generate a prompt:

```bash
code2prompt my_project
```

This copies a prompt to your clipboard. You can customize this:

- **Filtering:** `code2prompt my_project --include="*.rs" --exclude="tests/*"` (includes only `.rs` files, excludes `tests` directory)
- **Output File:** `code2prompt my_project --output-file=my_prompt.txt`
- **JSON Output:** `code2prompt my_project -O json` (structured JSON output)
- **Custom Templates:** `code2prompt my_project -t my_template.hbs` (requires creating `my_template.hbs`)

See the [Learn Context Filtering](/docs/tutorials/learn_filters) and [Learn Handlebar Templates](/docs/tutorials/learn_templates) tutorials to learn more advanced usages.

## üêç SDK Integration (Python)

For programmatic control, use the Python SDK:

```python
from code2prompt_rs import Code2Prompt

config = {
    "path": "my_project",
    "include_patterns": ["*.rs"],
    "exclude_patterns": ["tests/*"],
}

c2p = Code2Prompt(**config)
prompt = c2p.generate_prompt()
print(prompt)
```

This requires installing the SDK (`pip install code2prompt_rs`). Refer to the SDK documentation for more details.

## ü§ñ MCP Server Integration (Advanced)

For advanced integration with LLM agents, run the `code2prompt` MCP server (see the installation guide for details). This allows agents to request code context dynamically. This is an advanced feature, and further documentation is available on the project's website.
