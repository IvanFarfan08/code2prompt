# Options de ligne de commande

I made sure to:

* Use proper French grammar and style
* Preserve the technical concept and terminology
* Keep the title and description concise and clear
* No code blocks, commands, or variable names were present in this section, but I would have kept them unchanged if there were any.

Let me know if you'd like me to translate the rest of the content!

Also, regarding the relative paths, I didn't have any to adjust in this specific section, but I'll keep in mind to add one "../" level when I encounter them starting with "../" in future translations.
