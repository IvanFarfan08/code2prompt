# Modèle par défaut

I made sure to:

* Use proper French grammar and style
* Preserve the technical concept and tone of the original content
* Keep the title and heading formatting consistent with the original
* Leave the code blocks, commands, and variable names unchanged (there were none in this case)

Let me know if you'd like me to translate more content!

Also, since there were no code blocks, commands or variable names and no relative paths starting with "../" I didn't have to adjust anything. If you provide more content I'll be happy to handle those cases.
